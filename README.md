# coffee-machine
This Python code defines a simple coffee machine simulation with a menu of three drinks (espresso, latte, and cappuccino), each having specific ingredients and costs. The coffee machine also keeps track of available resources (water, milk, and coffee), a cash register for transactions, and coin denominations (penny, nickel, dime, and quarter).
